## CipherSafe: Steganography Tool

**Introduction**

CipherSafe is a powerful steganography tool designed to ensure secure communication by concealing messages within text or images using various steganography techniques. It enables the hiding of text or images within other media such as text, audio, video, or images, allowing the transfer of information through insecure communication channels without detection or decryption by unauthorized parties.

Steganography is the practice of concealing sensitive information within seemingly innocuous carriers, such as images, audio files, or text. It focuses on hiding the existence of the information, making it difficult for adversaries to detect or intercept the hidden data.

## How to Run the Project

To utilize CipherSafe, follow the steps below:

**1. Clone the Repository** 

Clone the Steganography repository by executing the following command:

        git clone https://github.com/annurag-24/Steganography
        
**2. Install Dependencies**

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

         pip install -r requirements.txt

**3. Run the Application**

Execute the main.py file to start the CipherSafe application:

         python main.py
        
## Usage
Upon launching the CipherSafe application, you will be presented with a user-friendly interface that facilitates easy interaction with the tool.

**Follow the steps below to leverage the steganography capabilities offered by CipherSafe:**

**Select Operation:** Choose the desired operation from the available options, such as hiding text within an image, extracting hidden text from an image, hiding an image within another image, or extracting a hidden image from a carrier image.

**Provide Input Files:** Depending on the selected operation, you will need to provide the necessary input files. For instance, when hiding text within an image, you will need to provide the carrier image and the text file to be hidden. Similarly, when extracting hidden text from an image, you will need to provide the image file containing the hidden text.

**Perform the Operation:** Once the required input files are provided, initiate the operation. CipherSafe will apply the appropriate steganography technique to hide or extract the desired data as per your selection.

**Review the Output:** After the operation is completed, the resulting file will be displayed or saved, depending on the operation. Take note of the output file for further analysis or sharing with the intended recipient.

## Conclusion
CipherSafe is an advanced steganography tool that empowers users to securely transmit information through covert channels. By leveraging the various steganography techniques, CipherSafe enables the concealment of messages within text, audio, video, or images, making it challenging for adversaries to detect or intercept the hidden data. With CipherSafe, you can ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your sensitive information during communication.
